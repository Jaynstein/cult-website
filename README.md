1. Define your goal clearly:*
   - Create a CV builder that is simple, fast, mobile-friendly.
   - Industry-tailored formatting (Finance, Tech, Healthcare, Consulting, etc.).
   - Export CVs as clean, ATS-friendly PDFs.

2. *Decide on Features:*
   - User signup/login (optional if you want to save data).
   - User form for input: 
     - Personal details
     - Past jobs
     - Current role
     - Extracurriculars
     - Skills
     - Languages
   - Choose industry (dropdown menu).
   - Dynamic bullet point generator based on roles/skills.
   - Download PDF or email it.

3. *Sketch the User Flow:*
   - Home → Start Building → Fill Inputs → Preview → Download.

4. *Design Mockups (wireframes):*
   - Use Figma or Canva.
   - Keep it minimal: no clutter, clean fonts like *Open Sans, **Roboto, **Inter*.

## *STEP 2: Tech Stack Selection*

| Frontend | Backend | AI/NLP | Database | Hosting |
|:---------|:--------|:-------|:---------|:--------|
| React.js or Next.js | Node.js + Express | OpenAI API (or your own prompt system) | PostgreSQL (or Firebase for early stage) | Vercel, AWS, or Railway.app |

Optional: Use *TailwindCSS* for beautiful and quick UI building.

---

## *STEP 3: Form Building (Frontend)*

1. *Create Input Form Components*:
   - Personal Info: Name, Email, Location (City, Country)
   - Current Job: Role Title, Company, Start Date, Description
   - Past Jobs: Add multiple roles
   - Extracurriculars: Activities, Organizations, Achievements
   - Skills: List (maybe tags)
   - Languages: List
   - Industry Selection: Dropdown (e.g., Tech, Finance, Consulting, Healthcare)

2. *Validation*:
   - Required fields
   - Date formats
   - Auto-suggestions (optional, like common skills e.g., “Excel”, “Project Management”)

---

## *STEP 4: Backend + AI Integration*

1. *When User Submits Form:*
   - Collect all inputs.
   - Create a *structured JSON* like:
     json
     {
       "personal_info": {...},
       "current_job": {...},
       "past_jobs": [...],
       "extracurriculars": [...],
       "skills": [...],
       "languages": [...],
       "target_industry": "Finance"
     }
     

2. *Pass this JSON to an AI engine* to generate:
   - Bullet points
   - Summary statements
   - Skills highlights
   - Tailored wording depending on industry.

*Prompt example if using OpenAI API:*
> “Create an ATS-friendly CV for the following user data. Make it tailored for the Finance industry. Use bullet points under work experiences, highlight quantifiable achievements, and include strong action verbs. Output in clean markdown format.”

---

## *STEP 5: CV Formatting (ATS-Friendly Templates)*

1. *Template Engine:*
   - You can use a markdown → PDF generator (like markdown-pdf in Node.js).
   - OR use *React-PDF* to dynamically generate clean PDFs from the AI output.

2. *Templates Must Be:*
   - Simple fonts (Calibri, Arial, Times New Roman)
   - No images, no tables (bad for ATS)
   - Clear section headings: Experience, Education, Skills, Languages
   - Bullet points, no huge paragraphs

You can allow the user to *choose templates* (maybe 2-3 options: Modern, Classic, Minimalist).

---

## *STEP 6: Export / Download*

- When CV is ready:
  - Preview screen (user can edit minor things if needed).
  - Button to *Download as PDF*.
  - Optionally: Email it to themselves (builds your mailing list!).

---

## *STEP 7: (Optional) User Accounts*

- *Login/Signup* if you want users to save multiple CVs.
- Integrate OAuth (Google login) if you want fast onboarding.
- Save CVs in database for quick future access.

---

## *STEP 8: Launch & Monetize*

- *Launch Free Version:*  
  1 free CV generation.

- *Monetize:*  
  - Pay to unlock premium templates  
  - Pay for unlimited edits  
  - Monthly membership (like $5/month)

- *Growth ideas:*  
  - Partner with job boards  
  - Offer resume review services (upsell by humans)  
  - LinkedIn profile optimization (future product)
